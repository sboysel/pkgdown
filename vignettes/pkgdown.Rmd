The goal of pkgdown is to make it easy for package developers to make elegant and useful packages websites. The defaults are tailored for smaller packages and for use on GitHub (particularly with new [`docs/` directory][docs] support), but it is flexible enough to be used as part of a bigger website. There are five parts to a pkgdown site:

1. Home page
1. Function reference
1. Articles
1. News
1. Navbar 

To build a pkgdown site, run `build_site()`. The function has some arguments (mostly to control where the output), but most of the configuration options are controlled by `_pkgdown.yaml`. These options include:

* The site `title`, if different from the package name.

* A path to a set of `template`, if you want to override the default
  page templates provided by the site.

* A [`bootswatch`](https://bootswatch.com) theme name to easily tweak the
  overall appearance of the site.

Other options control the appearance of the other parts of the site. 

## Home page

The home page will be automatically generated from one of the following four files:

1. `index.Rmd`
1. `index.md`
1. `README.Rmd`
1. `README.md`

pkgdown tries them in order, which means that if you want different display for GitHub and pkgdown, you can have both `README.md` and a `index.md`

When including big graphics in the README, you may find it easier to use `knitr::include_graphics("foo.png")` combined with chunk option `out.width = '100%'`. This will make the graphic scale with the size of the page.

## Reference

The function reference generates one page for each `.Rd` file in `man/`, placing the results in `reference/`. This is mostly a straightforward translation of Rd to HTML, along with evaluating the examples, and auto-linking function names to their documentation.

pkgdown will also generate an overall index, which by default, is just an alphabetically ordered list of functions. However, the index is better with human curation because functions can be grouped by function and described en masse. To override the defaults, provide a `reference` key in `_pkgdown.yml`:

```yaml
reference:
  - title: "Connecting to Spark"
    desc: >
      Functions for installing Spark components and managing
      connections to Spark
    contents: 
      - spark_config
      - spark_connect
      - spark_disconnect
      - spark_install
      - spark_log
  - title: "Reading and Writing Data"
    desc: "Functions for reading and writing Spark DataFrames."
    contents:
      - starts_with("spark_read")
      - starts_with("spark_write")
      - sdf-saveload
```

The `reference` should be an array of objects containing `title`, `desc` (description), and list of `contents`. Since common prefix and suffixes are often used for functional grouping, you can use the functions `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` to automatically include all functions with a common prefix or suffix. To match more complex patterns, use `matches()` with a regular expression.

The objects in `reference` can also contain a list of `exclude`, which allow you to exclude unwanted topics included via `contents`.

pkgdown will warn if you've forgotten to include any non-internal functions.

## Articles

pkgdown will automatically build all `.Rmd` vignettes, including those in subdirectories, and render output to `articles/`. pkgdown will ignore the output format defined in the yaml header, and always use `html_fragment(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE)`.

If you want to include an article on the website, but not in the package (e.g. because it's large), you can either place it in a subdirectory of `vignettes/` or add to `.Rbuildignore`. As well, you must ensure that there is no `vignettes:` section in the article's yaml header. In the extreme case where you want to produce only articles but not vignettes, you can add the complete `vignettes/` directory to `.Rbuildignore`.

As with the function reference, articles will also get a default index, and it can be customised in a similar way (referring to file names rather than function names):

```yaml
articles:
  - title: "Extend shiny"
    desc: >
      These packages provide advanced features that can enhance your Shiny 
      apps.
    contents:
    - shinydashboard
    - shinythemes
    - shinyjs
    - htmlwidgets
```

## News

If `NEWS.md` is present, it will be parsed into pieces broken up by second level headings. These will be rendered to `news/`, with one page per minor release (so that `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, and `2.2.2` are all described on a single page).

If you want more detailed release notes (aimed at teaching people about the new features), you could put these in (e.g.) `vignettes/news` and customise the navbar.

## Navbar {#navbar2}

By default, the navbar will show:

* The home page, with a "home" icon.
* "Get Started", if you have an article with the same name as the package.
* Reference
* Articles, if present.
* News, if present.
* A link to your your github repo (if listed in the `DESCRIPTION` url field).

You can override the defaults to:

* Surface important articles directly from the navbar (a la
  <http://spark.rstudio.com>).

* Provide deeper add additional hierarchical navigation (like     
  <http://www.htmlwidgets.org>).
  
* Link to other, off-site, resources.

The navbar has a similar structure to the [R Markdown website navbar][rmarkdown navbar]. To customise, use the `navbar` field:

```yaml
navbar:
  title: "sparklyr"
  type: inverse
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "dplyr"
      href: articles/dplyr.html
    - text: "ML"
      href: articles/ML.html
    - text: "Extensions"
      href: articles/extensions.html
    - text: "Deployment"
      href: articles/deployment.html
    - text: "Reference"
      href: "reference/"
  right:
    - icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr
```
